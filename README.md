Math:

Calculus and Linear Algebra: undergrad class would be the best, refresher notes from CS229 link
Probability: Harvard Stats110 link; book from the same professor
Statistics: Shaum's Outline link
Numerical Methods and Optimization: these are two different topics really, college courses are probably the best bet. I have yet to find good online courses for them. But don't worry, most interviews won't really touch on them.
