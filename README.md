**Math**
- Calculus and Linear Algebra: undergrad class would be the best, refresher notes from CS229
- Probability: Harvard Stats110 link; book from the same professor
- Statistics: Shaum's Outline link

**thick wall**
- Numerical Optimization: these are two different topics really, college courses are probably the best bet. I have yet to find good online courses for them.
- Financial Math : . . .
